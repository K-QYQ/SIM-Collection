For now, I have decided to not have a section
on blind SIM until I have had time to sort through much
more of the accumulated publications:

* _novel_ [iterative / deconvolution / blind reconstruction approaches](#blind)

# Novel iterative / deconvolution-like / blind approaches

There are various new approaches to SIM reconstruction that do not rely on directly
separating out bands in Fourier space, but rely on numerically solving a set of equations,
and even allow to estimate both sample structure and illumination pattern through the
means of non-linear solvers. Here are a few key publications I've seen in this field:

* Using a blind approach to compensate for aberrations in thick samples:



* Reconstructing from very few images (have to check which algorithm is used)
> Ströhl, Florian, and Clemens F. Kaminski. 
> _Speed limits of structured illumination microscopy._
> Optics Letters 42 #13 2511-2514, 2017.
> [doi:10.1364/OL.42.002511](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.42.002511)

* Also using less images (4), by means of compressed sensing
> Meiniel, William, Piernicola Spinicelli, Elsa D. Angelini, Alexandra Fragola, 
> Vincent Loriette, François Orieux, Eduardo Sepulveda, and Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin. 
> _Reducing data acquisition for fast Structured Illumination Microscopy using Compressed Sensing._
>  Biomedical Imaging, IEEE 14th International Symposium, pp. 32-35, 2017.
> [doi:10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950461](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950461)
