# Introduction

This page contains a commented collection
of publications with a focus on super-resolution structured
illumination microscopy. This is mostly for me to keep
track on where to find certain aspects written down
and published, but might also be useful to others.

The publications listed here will be on the technical side
of things (construction of SR-SIM microscopes and reconstruction
algorithms), looking at applications is (a) too much and (b)
not really my field.

If you think anything is missing (I only update this on a as-needed basis),
or my comments are wrong / off / incomplete, just let me know ([main page](../index.html) with contact info).

# In Transition

Currently, this page is in progress of being transitioned from the old LaTeX-based PDF to the new HTML page.
